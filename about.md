### Bio

A lifelong explorer of patterns—both mathematical and musical—I am a 47-year-old enthusiast of mathematics, computer science, and the deep connections between logic and creativity. I hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Elizabeth City State University and a graduate degree in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Currently, I serve as the Director of Data Engineering at Trader Interactive, where I lead initiatives at the intersection of data architecture, systems design, and intelligent automation.

My intellectual passions revolve around complexity, emergence, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and the nature of consciousness—questions that blur the boundaries between science and philosophy. Outside of work, I find expression through blues music. I play both the guitar and harmonica, and I’m continually inspired by the raw, expressive power of the blues to reveal deeper human truths.

Whether building scalable data systems or jamming to a classic blues riff, I’m driven by curiosity, precision, and the pursuit of elegant solutions in both code and composition.
